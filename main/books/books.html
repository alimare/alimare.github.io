							Grom's dreams of claiming the Blood Gut Tournament Shield are about to be realized, now that he has found a new champion for his team. The ten-foot Ogre-Orc mix, Og, joins Grom's brother Zoldac, and their friend Zuggi, the Troll, to form the perfect team. It's what Grom's not expecting, that leads his Axe Hammer team into the middle of one of the most exciting events in Xavria's history--the power struggle between the politically-empowered Xavs and the uprising of the people's Guilds. Travel through the rich land of Xavria with a group of unlikely heroes. In a world filled with magic, hopes, and dreams (from battling beasts from the depths of the Underworld to flying on the back of Dragons)...the adventure never stops.
