							Scum							
						</div>
						<div >												
							Scum is a card game where the object of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. The first person to get rid of all of their cards becomes King.
							<br><br>
							The next player becomes Vice, the last player becomes Scum, and the second-to-last person to go out becomes Film.The status of each player makes a difference. The King trades his two lowest cards for Scum's two highest cards. The Vice and Film do the same thing except that they trade only one card. The game continues and on each round the status can change.
							<br><br>
							
							<b>Rules of the Game:</b>
							Each player must play a card higher than the card last played. If there were no cards last played, than the player can play any card they want. If a player can't or doesn't want to play, they can pass. Each player can pass or play more than once per round. A round ends when no player can or will play. Players may put down more than one card, but the cards have to be the same number. When such cards have been played, then the next player must put down a combination that is higher. Aces are greater than any face card and other cards go in order. Jokers are wild. That means that they can win any combo or single card and they only need to be played solo (one Joker).
							<br><br>
							<i>NOTE:</i>
							The computer randomly picks a player to start. Set up the amount and names of players. Defaults are given at the start.
							<br><br>
							<b>Defaults:</b><br>
							- 4 players
							- One deck (54 cards). It is recommended that two decks be used when there are more than 4 players. When it's the human's turn to select the cards, left click on the card(s) you would like to play.
							- When you have selected the card(s), click the play button. If you can't play, click the pass button.
